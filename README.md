This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hi! This is the setup guide for this app:
-use a code editor of your choice
-install node.js from their website(latest version)
-open the project folder in your console
-run 'npm install' in the console
-after the installation is complete, run 'npm start'

External libraries used:
-I've used 'moment' library in order to format the hacker-news api date data into human-readable date strings
-I've used 'react-waypoint' as it simplifies the implementation of the infinite scroll
-I've used 'react-router-dom' for the routing purposes
